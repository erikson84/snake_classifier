# Snake classifier
This is just a simple project on computer vision to identify if snakes in pictures are venomous or nonvenomous. 

DISCLAIMER: This is not a serious application, do not use it if you believe your life is in danger! Based only on common Bralizian venomous and nonvenomous snakes species.
